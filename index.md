## Mission

Censorship Factor Analysis Independent Laboratory (CensorFail) is dedicated to provide novel and robust solution against Internet censorship. We are committed to the development of censorship detection, attack resistance evaluation and circumvention solutions.

Censorship and circumventions are like a cat and mouse game. In the past, the circumvention tools lacked the agility and have always been falling short on the countermeasures against new censorship techniques. CensorFail is dedicated to turn the tables by developing a new ecosystem for censorship circumvention: Instead of a single circumvention tool or a group of tools, we are building a standard procedure to design, evaluate, deploy and maintain circumvention mechanisms. In addition to that, we actively probe the censorship mechanisms/setups established by major censoring parties so that we can always stay on top of the game.

## Team

We are a group of researchers from the University of Colorado, the University of California, Tohoku University and the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. In We are also collaborating with researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Michigan, and Columbia University.

As a non-profit organization, we are always looking for ambitious and innovative new members to join our team. If you are interested in joining us and contribute to the censorship circumvention, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Compensations and co-authorship are available for the qualified candidates.
