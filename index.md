## Mission

Censorship Factor Analysis Independent Laboratory (CensorFail) is a council-like academic organization dedicated to produce quality research and solutions against Internet censorship. We are committed to the development of censorship detection, attack resistance solutions, and circumvention solutions.

The relation between the censorship and circumventions is like a cat and mouse game. In the past, the circumvention community lacked the agility and have always been falling short on the countermeasures against new censorship techniques. CensorFail is dedicated to turn the tables with new ecosystems for censorship circumvention: Instead of a single circumvention tool or a group of tools, we hereby build a standard operating procedure to respond to new censorship techniques deployed by the censoring parties. 

## Team

Our council is made of researchers from the [University of California](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/), the [University of Colorado](https://www.cu.edu/), [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/) and the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/). 

We are also collaborating with researchers from many other institutes including Northeastern University, the University of Michigan, and Columbia University.

We always welcome passionate new members to our council. If you are interested in joining us and contribute to the censorship circumvention, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. You will get opportunities to work with our researchers and engineers on the cutting-edge research topics, and compensations and co-authorship may be made available based on your contributions.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at `contact(at)censor.fail`. An ADMIN team member will get back to you as soon as possible.
